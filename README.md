## Virtual Reality Windows for Claustrophobia Mitigation

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a study investigating the potential of virtual reality (VR) to alleviate claustrophobia in confined spaces.

### Abstract

This study investigates the potential of virtual reality (VR) technology to alleviate the psychological discomfort associated with confined spaces. By simulating virtual windows in a mixed reality environment, we hypothesize that users will experience a significant reduction in stress and anxiety, leading to improved cognitive performance. Three groups were evaluated: one using VR headsets with the virtual window solution, one using only VR headsets, and a control group without VR headsets. Participants completed a series of cognitive tasks designed to measure accuracy, response time, and stress indicators. Our findings suggest that the VR window solution can effectively enhance comfort and performance in confined spaces, with implications for applications in correctional facilities and small student dormitories.

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To evaluate the effectiveness of virtual windows in VR environments for reducing stress and anxiety in confined spaces.
2. To assess the impact of virtual windows on cognitive performance in confined spaces.
3. To explore the potential applications of VR technology for improving well-being in various settings, such as correctional facilities and student dormitories.

### Repository Structure

* **`data-analysis`:** Contains the code and scripts used to analyze the data collected from the study participants.
* **`documents`:** Includes the LaTeX document detailing the research methodology, findings, and conclusions.
* **`graphs`:** Stores the PNG images of the graphs and visualizations generated during data analysis.
* **`unity-game`:** Houses the Unity project used to create the VR environment with virtual windows.

### Reproducing the Results

To reproduce the findings of this study, follow these steps:

1. **Install Unity:** Download and install the Unity game engine from the official website.
2. **Open Unity Project:** Open the Unity project located in the `unity-game` directory.
3. **Run the Simulation:** Build and run the VR simulation on a compatible VR headset.
4. **Collect Data:** Gather data from participants using the VR simulation, including cognitive task performance, stress indicators, and subjective feedback.
5. **Analyze Data:** Use the code and scripts in the `data-analysis` directory to analyze the collected data.
6. **Generate Visualizations:** Create graphs and visualizations using the analysis scripts and save them in the `graphs` directory.
7. **Compile the Document:** Compile the LaTeX document in the `documents` directory to generate the final research paper.

### Dependencies

* **Unity:** The VR simulation requires a compatible version of the Unity game engine.
* **VR Headset:** A VR headset is necessary to experience the virtual environment.
* **Python:** The data analysis scripts are written in Python and may require additional libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

### Additional Notes

* The `data-analysis` directory may contain raw data files, which are not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.
* The specific versions of Unity and Python libraries used in this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file (if applicable).
